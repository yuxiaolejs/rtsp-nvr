# General parameters

# Sets the verbosity of the program; available values are "error", "warn", "info", "debug".
logLevel: info
# Destinations of log messages; available values are "stdout", "file" and "syslog".
logDestinations: [stdout]
# If "file" is in logDestinations, this is the file which will receive the logs.
logFile: mediamtx.log

# Timeout of read operations.
readTimeout: 10s
# Timeout of write operations.
writeTimeout: 10s
# Number of read buffers.
# A higher value allows a wider throughput, a lower value allows to save RAM.
readBufferCount: 512
# Maximum size of payload of outgoing UDP packets.
# This can be decreased to avoid fragmentation on networks with a low UDP MTU.
udpMaxPayloadSize: 1472

# HTTP URL to perform external authentication.
# Every time a user wants to authenticate, the server calls this URL
# with the POST method and a body containing:
# {
#   "ip": "ip",
#   "user": "user",
#   "password": "password",
#   "path": "path",
#   "protocol": "rtsp|rtmp|hls|webrtc",
#   "id": "id",
#   "action": "read|publish",
#   "query": "query"
# }
# If the response code is 20x, authentication is accepted, otherwise
# it is discarded.

# Enable the HTTP API.
api: yes
# Address of the API listener.

# Enable Prometheus-compatible metrics.
metrics: no
# Address of the metrics listener.

# Enable pprof-compatible endpoint to monitor performances.
pprof: no
# Address of the pprof listener.
pprofAddress: 127.0.0.1:9999

# Command to run when a client connects to the server.
# Prepend ./ to run an executable in the current folder (example: "./ffmpeg")
# This is terminated with SIGINT when a client disconnects from the server.
# The following environment variables are available:
# * RTSP_PORT: server port
runOnConnect:
# Restart the command if it exits.

# WebRTC parameters

# Disable support for the WebRTC protocol.

# Address of the WebRTC listener.

# Enable TLS/HTTPS on the WebRTC server.
webrtcEncryption: no
# Path to the server key.
# This can be generated with:

# Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header provided in every HTTP response.
# This allows to play the WebRTC stream from an external website.
webrtcAllowOrigin: '*'
# List of IPs or CIDRs of proxies placed before the WebRTC server.
# If the server receives a request from one of these entries, IP in logs
# will be taken from the X-Forwarded-For header.
webrtcTrustedProxies: []
# List of ICE servers, in format type:user:password:host:port or type:host:port.
# type can be "stun", "turn" or "turns".
# STUN servers are used to obtain the public IP of server and clients. They are
# needed when server and clients are on different LANs.
# TURN servers are needed when a direct connection between server and clients
# is not possible. All traffic is routed through the chosen TURN server.
# if user is "AUTH_SECRET", then authentication is secret based.
# the secret must be inserted into the password field.
#webrtcICEServers: [stun:stun.l.google.com:19302]
webrtcICEServers: []
# List of public IP addresses that are to be used as a host.
# This is used typically for servers that are behind 1:1 D-NAT.
webrtcICEHostNAT1To1IPs: []
# Address of a ICE UDP listener in format host:port.
# If filled, ICE traffic will pass through a single UDP port,
# allowing the deployment of the server inside a container or behind a NAT.
webrtcICEUDPMuxAddress:
# Address of a ICE TCP listener in format host:port.
# If filled, ICE traffic will pass through a single TCP port,
# allowing the deployment of the server inside a container or behind a NAT.
# Setting this parameter forces usage of the TCP protocol, which is not
# optimal for WebRTC.
